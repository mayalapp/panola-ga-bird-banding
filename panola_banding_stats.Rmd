# NOTES FROM CHARLIE 
# Big ones: Blue Grosbeak,Common Yellowthroat, Eastern Bluebird, Field Sparrow, Indigo Bunting, Savannah Sparrow, Swamp  Sparrow, and Yellow-breasted Chat 
# 
# Additional: American Kestrel, Bobolink, Grasshopper Sparrow, Henslow's Sparrow, LeConte's Sparrow, Lincoln's Sparrow, Loggerhead Shrike, Eastern Kingbird, Prairie Warbler, Wilson's Snipe, Sedge Wren, Vesper Sparrow and Yellow Warbler 
# 
# Western Palm Warbler and Yellow Palm Warbler are 2 subspecies of Palm Warbler and can be lumped for analysis.
# 
# Trail's Flycatcher and Willow Flycatcher are more or less the same species and can be lumped.
# 
# Eastern Phoebe is a WEIRD one.  It's not a grassland bird, but we catch loads of them - and they are almost all recently-fledged juveniles.  And we almost never recapture them.  I really need an analysis of them, but not sure how to handle it.
